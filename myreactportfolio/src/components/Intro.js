          I am a detail-oriented, organized and meticulous professional. I work
          at a fast pace to meet tight deadlines. I'm an enthusiastic team
          player ready to contribute to company success. I have a very unique
          experience that makes me as well rounded as you can be and I think
          that will make me a great software engineer/developer. I am willing to
          learn anything and will do so quickly. I can be a great asset for your
          business that can wear multiple hats and produce excellent work.

      <h1>Background</h1>
      <strong>
        <p className="py-2">
          I was born and raised in Wauconda, IL. After high school, I went to
          Iowa State University where I studied mechanical engineering. I
          graduated Magna Cumme Laude with a GPA of 3.66. After being an
          engineer for a couple years, I decided to move away from Illinois to
          AZ and began a job at rocket mortgage where I developed my
          communication skills deeply. During my time at rocket mortgage, I
          studied and graduated at Michigan State University with a coding
          bootcamp certificate in the MERN tech stack. I am now pursuing a
          career in software development.
